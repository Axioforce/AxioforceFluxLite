Review the recent changes with a focus on structure, reuse, and safety. Start with a brief sequential plan and definition of done. Use Serena to identify the correct owner modules, call sites, and wiring points for the new or modified functionality. Before allowing new helpers or logic, search for reusable components and avoid duplication. If any file is approaching ~250 lines or taking on multiple responsibilities, propose and apply a split into small focused modules. Use ripgrep to confirm there are zero stale references to old symbols or paths, and only consider the task complete once structure, wiring, and reuse rules are satisfied.
