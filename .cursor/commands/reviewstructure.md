Review the entire codebase for structural quality. Identify files that are overly large, tightly coupled, or acting as “god files.” Verify that logic is broken into small, reusable components with clear responsibilities. Check that data access and mutations follow consistent CRUD-style patterns and are not mixed with presentation or orchestration logic. Flag structural violations, explain why they are a problem, and propose concrete refactors (file splits, responsibility shifts, or new modules) without making changes automatically.
