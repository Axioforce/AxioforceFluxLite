Perform a lightweight health check of the codebase. Analyze overall structure and responsibility boundaries, identifying any files approaching god-file territory or mixing concerns. Look for likely duplication by checking whether recent helpers or logic could reuse existing components. Use Serena to spot suspicious dependency patterns or overly central modules, and use ripgrep to identify repeated logic or stale references. Do not refactor yet—only report findings, risks, and a prioritized list of recommended structural improvements.
