Prove the refactor is complete and behavior-preserving. Use Serena to list all references, call sites, and wiring points for the refactored symbols or modules and confirm they point to the new locations. Use ripgrep to search for old module paths, filenames, and symbol names and verify results are empty or explicitly justified. Summarize what moved, where it is now wired, and confirm there are no remaining stale references.
