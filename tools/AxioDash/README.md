# AxioDash

AxioDash is a web dashboard tool used alongside FluxLite/FluxDeluxe.

## Current state

- This repo currently hosts AxioDash as a **remote web tool** inside the FluxDeluxe launcher.
- The configured URL lives in `tools/AxioDash/tool_spec.py`.

## Future

When we bring AxioDash code into this monorepo, it should live under this folder (e.g. a Streamlit app entrypoint, shared libraries, packaging, etc.).
